It seems to have an autosomal dominant pattern on my father's side of the family, and includes daily weakness and loss-of-consciousness episodes coming from food.  For me, there is also documented full-body paralysis including full breathing paralysis (causing an emergency) and many other abnormal and severe reactions to many common hospital medications. 

Like other forms of hypokalemic periodic paralysis, the age of onset of the symptoms for me was at 20 years of age. The next generation in the family is now beginning to be affected. Unlike other forms of PP, my symptoms include cardiac symptoms, CNS symptoms and pancreatic symptoms, all in response to food. There are many severe medication reactions, of course.

I have had genetic tests for the most common genes for periodic paralysis, but these tests were negative, likewise negative tests for the common pseudocholinesterase deficiency genes.

I have been told that the cause is most likely a ""medically new"" channelopathy. If so, it is currently undiscovered.

My own feeling is that the disorder is more severe for me because of the effects of several genes, not just one gene. In particular, I suspect the main abnormality is in genes that are directly or indirectly involved in the potassium ATP channels, which could explain why I have such severe symptoms.

2. I have EKG's from a Holter test that document unusual cardiac reactions. Before eating, the EKG looked very good and the heart rate was 60 bpm. After eating, tachycardia took place, where the resting heart rate rose to 128 bpm and there were many arrhythmias and irregularities. The EKG's didn't even look like EKG's anymore. The episodes lasted for about 5 hours, slowly subsiding almost to normal again at the end, but then it was time for the next meal. Because there were three meals, about five hours apart, there were fifteen hours of abnormal EKG patterns, all subisiding by the end of the 5 hour interval, recorded on the Holter.

hu3A1B15,7/16/2011 13:32:40,91a2fe19b2cf95bae4316d771fd70360,30-39 years,I am comfortable making my genome sequence data publicly available without prior review.,Yes,"I have an expanded CAG repeat of 37 in the huntingtin gene, but am asymptomatic (at age 37). CAG repeats of 40 and above are fully penetrant for Huntington's Disease (HD), a rare, fatal neurodegenerative, autosomal dominant disease for which there currently exists no treatment. Although the most common age of onset for HD for those with 40 or more CAG repeats is the 30s, age of onset varies considerably and is inversely correlated with number of CAG repeats. That said, the number of repeats does not account for all of the variation in age of onset, and the conventional wisdom is that secondary genes likely account for the remaining variation.

CAG repeats between 35 and 39 (roughly) are associated with reduced penetrance. While clinical HD is rare, ""intermediate range"" HD alleles, both expressed and unexpressed, are even rarer, at least as represented in the clinic and in the literature. When I was tested, circa 2002, predictions about probability of developing HD within a normal lifetime were based, for each allele in the 35-39 range, on an n of a handful individuals. Based on that data, I was told that the 37 allele confers roughly a 50% chance of developing HD within a normal lifespan, with age of onset varying considerably among the handful of known symptomatic individuals, from the early 30s to the 80s. That said, more recent research questions the basis on which these predictions were made. It's likely that those with intermediate range alleles who are symptomatic or whose relatives (with whom they share secondary genes that may influence penetrance) are symptomatic are probably overrepresented (relative to others carrying an intermediate range allele) in the clinic and, thus, in the data. The incidence of intermediate CAG expansion is almost certainly much higher than the literature suggests, and may be higher than the incidence of 40+ CAG expansion, especially given the possibility of de novo mutations.

The parent from whom I inherited this allele also has a 37, is also asymptomatic (at age 62), and has expressed interest in participating in genetic research that may advance knowledge about HD. This parent was also comfortable undergoing partial sequencing (not, of course, including the huntingtin gene) through 23andMe. 

The grandfather from whom I inherited the allele was asymptomatic for HD upon death (in his early 80s), per clinical evaluations and as confirmed through analysis of brain tissue samples sent to MacLean's (the tissue showed one of the most advanced cases of Alzheimer's-related atrophy, etc. they had ever seen, but no signs of HD). That sample, sent around 2000, may still be available.

Members of my extended family have various fully-penetrant alleles (e.g., 45) and to date one member has died from HD. But they would not be interested in participating in the PGP.

At 28 I was diagnosed with massive brain bleed and underwent a craniotomy for a partial resection of my left parietal lobe.  Though there was a significant loss of brain due to both the bleed and surgery, there were no obvious neurological after effects, leading my neurologist to conclude that the bleed was congenital (AVM) and had been present since birth, resulting in constant small damage, and allowing my brain to rewire itself as it developed (rather than the trauma that would result if the same area of my brain were damaged in adulthood all at once.

At 47 I was diagnosed with Kidney Cancer (renal cell carcinoma) via an incidental finding during an appendectomy follow-up.

At 48, while recovering from the Kidney Cancer surgery, I began to have movement difficulties and was eventually diagnosed with a 6.5cm meningioma that was removed via craniotomy (and was located proximate to the previous AVM surgery) - subsequently additional small tumors (also meningioma or perhaps schwanoma) have been discovered via imaging.

And last, but not least, I am transgender (MtF), an awareness I have had since I was approx. 2 years old (and well before I had the vocabulary or analytical tools to understand what it meant.)",Congenital / present at birth,Very rare/uncommon,Moderate severity disease,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,"With respect to my meningiomas, I underwent an NF2 test (which turned out to be negative), but I have all of my brain MRI's available as DICOM files, showing both the meningiomas as well as the 'hole' left from the AVM resection.

With respect to my kidney cancer, i have CT scan files available as DICOM files, and would also be willing to share my doctor's notes.

My IQ consistently tests over 160, and typically in the 170-180's, for spatial skills and mathematic comprehension.  Verbal ability is within the high end of ""normal"".

I also have ""atrial branch delay"" as described by a cardiologist.  I have relevant medical data and testing information for this, but even with my EMT certification, this issue is too specific for me to describe after reading the information.  A cardiologist would have to comment on this further.  From what I understand, this is a rare, but trivial, electrical defect in the heart.

Further, I have recently been diagnosed with migraines, which apparently affects <1% of adult males.

I was a Kaiser patient for 20 years or so. They did the operation and a number of other related operations. I think that I could get my records from them. 

My father was an alcoholic and his father was an alcoholic.
My mother was diabetic and her mother was also diabetic.

I think that this is related to my compulsions.

It may not be rare enough for your study, but it has been a serious problem all my life.

My uncle has traced back my father's  family history for many generations.
I have a cousin that has traced back some of my ancestry on my mothers side in great depth. < http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=SRCH&db=pricefrielgrow&surname=P>  My mother and aunts and uncles all had Type 2. My cousin's daughter died of Type 1. 

To quote him: 
""My oldest daughter Amanda was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes just before her 3rd birthday in 1978.  At the time, I was not aware of any relatives on my side of the family nor her mother's who had juvenile diabetes.  Amanda died just before her 24th birthday.  Since then I have been very alert for anyone else in the family who may have had diabetes.  I later found out that Amanda's maternal grandmother had diabetes, probably Type 2, but she lived to 86.

Amanda suffered from another auto immune disease, interstitial nephritis.  She lost her kidneys at age 11.  In addition she suffered from seizures which were controlled with medication.  Amanda's younger sister and brother have not shown any sign of diabetes.

I learned last year that Teresa Friel Price's older brother Leo Bernard Friel had diabetes, and that his son Emmett William Friel died in 1946 from diabetes at age 27.  I assume this was type 1.

Also Mary Kathleen Curran, granddaughter of Teresa Price's older brother Emmett Albert Friel, told me that her son Jimmy Sloan contracted type 2 diabetes at age 42.

I am not aware of anyone else in the family who has been diagnosed with diabetes, but it is certainly possible.

My theory is some people are genetically predisposed to get Type 1 diabetes and that it takes a virus (coxsackie?) or stress to trigger it.  This gene may be in the Friel line.  I have not found anyone in the Price line with diabetes.

I would be interested to know if any of your family has diabetes.

QUESTION: ""Do you have a severe disease or rare non-disease trait you believe is strongly genetic in origin? Please describe.""

William Hamilton STEWART wrote the following on 2011/Jul/26.

1) SUPER MUSCULAR STRENGTH - I have been four times stronger than most people even though I never had any athletic training, etc..

The strength of every part of the bodies of college students was tested in the 1960s as part of a national survey for military purposes. One student in my Physical Education class at the University of South Carolina always doubled the test scores of all of the other boys. I always doubled his.

I was one of the last students in my class to be tested via a scale attached to a belt that was strapped around our waists. According to that scale, except for one boy and me, the most each of the approximately forty members of my Physical Education class at USC could lift was about 400 pounds.

I thought I would test the device to see how it felt before I tried very hard. I'll never forget the bulging eyes and expression on the face of USC football coach Lamar as I gently lifted up on that scale. He blurted out: ""Stewart, what did you do to that thing?"". He always cut my scores in half. I left well enough alone.

While my Uncle Joe STEWART and I were sitting at his kitchen table one day, the subject of our family's strength came up. I told him I could lift the back end of my 1958 VW (65% of the total weight of the vehicle). He did not believe me so we walked out into his front yard. His eyes bulged and his mouth flew open when he saw me snatch the rear wheels of my VW completely off the ground  with my bare hands. I stopped lifting my VW after it occurred to me that lifting that much weight might not be good for my spine.

My brother told me he had similar experiences. He grew several inches taller than me. My parents never abused my two brothers. My brothers and I never smoked or used alcohol and other drugs. My parents bought candy, colas, junk food snacks and toys for them, but never for me.  One of my Stewart cousins told me he was super strong too.

How much of our strength is genetic? My childhood environment was terrible.  My parents physically and mentally abused me from the time I was a baby until I graduated from High School and left their home. They worked me like a slave and starve me on a diet of grease and grits six days a week. It made me so sick every few weeks that I vomited and could not eat. I usually became well after a few days because my mother put me in bed and fed me some fruit salad. I was hospitalized when I was five or six years old because of a bone infection of a bruise, i.e., osteomyelitis. I spent several years in hospitals because there was no penecillin for the civilian population during World War II.

A doctor who measured my pulse when I was a teenager said it was 39. Until a few years ago my resting heart rate was still 39.

2) FAST RUNNER - I enrolled in a jogging course at USC during the 1980s. For our final grades college students who were half my age and I had to run two miles around a square athletic field. We had to run around that field four and half laps on grass in order to run one mile. We had to slow down 18 times every mile because we were not allowed to cut corners. I ran the first mile in four and a half minutes so the two timers shouted for me to slow down. I paid no attention to them and ran the second mile in four and a half minutes too. I felt that I could run at that speed all day long. I never push myself to the limit because I do not want to risk injuring myself. I and another guy received the only ""A"" grade in that jogging course.

3) FAST SWIMMER - I won all the swimming and other athletic competitions at the camps (e.g., YMCA) that I attended during summer vacations as a child. I was never trained to do any sport.

4) INTELLIGENCE - The University of SC gave me some intelligence tests about 1960. I do not attribute my IQ score of about 140 to my having a better environment than most people. My mother spent her childhood working in a cotton mill. My alcoholic father could barely read and write.

5) POSSIBLE SENSITIVITY TO ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCES
* My nerves tingled so badly that I could hardly stand being swung back and forth when I was a child, possibly because my nerves are more sensitive to the earth's magnetic field than other people's.
* I felt the build up of an electromagnetic charge moments before I was struck by lightning in the 1970s (not strongly enough to kill me fortunately).
* The first time I attempted to use a cellular telephone it had a destructive effect on my nearby nerves and other tissues.

6) STRONG EMOTIONS - My dog had ten puppies. I love them and want them to be healthy and happy. I have wept because of the suffering and death of three of them. I also love people and science. I want our civilization to continue to survive and make progress.

7) MY ANCESTRY - All of my known maternal and paternal ancestors have lived in SC since the eighteenth century. Many of my cousins have had DNA tests. That all of them belong to Y-haplogroup ""R1b1a2"" and to haplogroup ""I"" may mean that I am of almost 100% European, i.e., Celtic and Viking (Germanic) ancestry.

I belong to Y-haplogroup ""R1b1a2a1a1b4"" (R-L 21, L459) and to the same Stewart family as the kings of Scotland.

PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS/GENETIC:
46,XX,der(8)t(8;12)(p23.1;p13.31). 
Using array nomenclature, Jacqui's translocation is described as: arr cgh 8p23.3p23.1(181,530-6,929,747)x1,12p13.3p13.31(100,682-8,123,572)x3. 

OTHER TRAITS:
(1.)Wolff-parkinson-White syndrome with two bypass tracts. (2.)Seizures with status epilepticus. (3.)EXTREME OBESITY SINCE INFANCY (the single most difficult part to deal with). Severely calorie restricted diet since infancy. (4.)Tumor/cyst on pineal gland adjacent to quadrigeminal plate. Not growimng or changing/followed with MRIs (5) Hypotonia. (6.)Hearing impaired (bilateral aids). (7.)Developmentally delayed (approx 55 IQ by testing- performs 10 points higher than tested IQ when not tikmed.) (8.) Hemiparesis. (9.)HARLEQUIN COLOR CHANGE from birth to age 6 months. (10.)Orthopedic involvment of feet (one varus and one valgus defor,ity. Club foot. One foot size 5 1/2 ladies shoe one foor size 9 1/2 shoe. (10.) High arched palate. (11.)narrow short forehead. (12.)Bushy eyebrows. (13.) Teeth=orthodontia and rooots resorbed.(14)TALKITIVE. (15) OCD. perseverates. (16) Happy Angelic temperament. (17.) excellent reader. (18.) Singing- a natural gift of a beautiful soprano singing voice is a strong quality. Only reporting most significant traits. leaving out all other traits for the present. etc.etc...

Waardenburg syndrome

Klein-Waardenburg syndrome; Waardenburg-Shah syndrome
Last reviewed: August 4, 2011.

Waardenburg syndrome is a group of conditions passed down through families that involve deafness and pale skin, hair, and eye color.

Causes, incidence, and risk factors

Waardenburg syndrome is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, meaning only one parent has to pass on the faulty gene for a child to be affected.

There are four main types of Waardenburg syndrome. The most common are Type I and Type II.

Type III (Klein-Waardenburg syndrome) and type IV (Waardenburg-Shah syndrome) are more rare.

The multiple types of this syndrome result from defects in different genes. Most people with this disease have a parent with the disease, but the symptoms in the parent can be quite different from those in the child.

Symptoms

Symptoms may include:

Cleft lip (rare)

Constipation

Deafness(more common in type II disease)

Extremely pale blue eyes or eye colors that don't match (heterochromia)

Pale color skin, hair, and eyes (partial albinism)

Difficulty completely straightening joints

Possible slight decrease in intellectual function

Wide-set eyes (in Type I)

White patch of hair or early graying of the hair

Less common types of this disease may cause problems with the arms or intestines.

Signs and tests

Tests may include:

Audiometry

Bowel transit time

Colon biopsy

Genetic testing

Treatment

There is no specific treatment. Symptoms will be treated as appropriate. Special diets and medicines to keep the bowel moving are prescribed to those patients who have constipation.

Expectations (prognosis)

Once hearing problems are corrected, most people with this syndrome should be able to lead a normal life. Those with rarer forms of the syndrome may have other complications.

Complications

Constipation severe enough to require part of large bowel to be removed

Hearing loss

Self-esteem problems, or other problems related to appearance

Slight decreased intellectual functioning (possible, unusual)

Slight increased risk for muscle tumor called rhabdomyosarcoma

My IQ consistently tests over 160, and typically in the 170-180's, for spatial skills and mathematic comprehension.  Verbal ability is within the high end of ""normal"".  Numerous family members have been above average at math, science, and spatial reasoning.

I also have ""ventricular branch delay"" as described by a cardiologist.  I have relevant medical data and testing information for this, but from my understanding of these tests, the most obvious result is that in my ECG, part of my R wave fires during my S wave creating a ""jaggie"" in the S wave.  From what I understand, this is a rare, but trivial, electrical defect in the heart, though a cardiologist would have to comment on this further.  There is a strong history of heart related illness in my family, so it is very possible this is genetically linked.

I have recently been diagnosed with migraines, which apparently affects <1% of adult males, and there is a strong history of headaches on my mother's side of the family.

I was tested at age 18 to have 115% of normal tidal volume for my external body measurements, and have been able to achieve a *standing* heart rate of 40 beats per minute due to exercise alone.  My father's side of the family have typically been endurance athletes in their early years, and most of us have ectomorph body types.

Finally, I appear to have inherited chronically low testosterone levels from my father, who also suffers from this condition.",Congenital / present at birth,Very rare/uncommon,Not applicable,No,Yes,No,Yes,"Mensa test results for IQ.

For heart information, all medical information should still be on file at the cardiologist's office to include NMRI, holter moniter data, echocardiogram video, stress test and EKG.  However, I do have the EKG printouts and the doctors written notes.

Heart rate would also come from cardiologist's information, and tidal volume data should be the same if tested now.

I'm hetrozygous for MTHFR C677T. When I was diagnosed in 1998, my homocysteine level was 48. That is pretty high for a CT. There have to be multiple factors at work to drive my homocysteine level so high. It isn't my diet as I'm a healthy eater. What could they be? Recently I came across a study that sheds some light on my question. I found out that in combination with MTFHR 677>CT, I am a homozygous CC for SLC19A1 rs819130 which supposedly causes a 10% increase of homocysteine levels in carriers on top of whatever effect the MTHFR>CT has. rs819130 is a folate transporter, but in CCs, not efficient. As far as I can tell, no one quite has a handle on high homocysteine yet. I follow the research avidly hoping to find out as much as I can about my condition, so I can figure out how to moderate my epigenome to counteract the effects. I've seen what it did to my father, my uncle and my grandmother. I'm aware of what it did to my great-grandmother. None of them lived long enough to be affected by late onset Alzheimer's but high homocysteine is a risk factor. Alzheimer's is definitely a fate I wish to avoid. So far I think my best bet is strenuous daily exercise and reducing my calorie and sugar intake. I also have risk factors for diabetes, so I've been trying to eat like a diabetic as best I can.
All the people in my family who share the high homocysteine trait are now deceased, so they won't be enrolling in PGP. My brother has a rare neurological disease. MSA (symptoms similar to ALS). He is enrolled in a trial through UCLA, but he's getting worse, and they think he's probably getting the placebo. His wife is planning to take hin to China for a stem cell transplant. However, I doubt that his issue is related to mine. I wouldn't dare ask him to enroll in PGP at this point.

I have a subscription to 23and me that allows me to browse raw date, so I'm able to correlate my condition to the latest genetic research on high homocysteine. I was first tipped off to my condition after my father had a heart attack in Canada. His cardiologist told him he had the highest level of homocysteine that had ever been tested in the lab that covers all of Western Canada and that his condition was genetic and all his children should be test for it. None of my sisters have it. I'm not sure about my brother, but I don't think he does either.

All my first degree relatives are or were alcoholics, with the possible exception of my mother.

I am of Irish descent on both sides, and German descent on my father's mother's side.

When I drink, I experience severe hangovers, which can last over 24 hours.

When I was an active drinker, I would drink very fast and be ahead of my companions, in terms of number of drinks, very early in the evening. Even when drinking alone, I would exhibit the same pattern.

My hypothesis is this: 

I am probably deficient in one of the enzymes that convert acetaldehyde (ACL) to CO2 and H2O. 

As the ACL builds up in my system, rather than experiencing the flushing reaction some people have, I just feel restless and uncomfortable, symptoms which another drink will mask. The result is a very heavy dose of alcohol in a short time, and a build up of ACL to virtual toxic levels, which my body then takes around 24 hours to clear, resulting in a severe, interminable hangover.

Although I cannot provide references,, I have read of other people who exhibit this pattern of drinking and this severity of hangover, and have read that it is related to an ACL enzyme deficiency common among Irish people.

I also have recently been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, though I do not have typical symptoms.  I initially had a brain MRI due to some cognitive issues I was having which I thought were due to migraines, and this showed lesions which was followed by a spinal tap that showed 9 protein bands confirming a differential diagnosis of MS.  However, I do not have the typical early symptoms.  I believe whatever I do have is genetic in nature because my mother was also diagnosed with MS around the same age. Her symptoms were more compelling in that she had visual issues as well as white matter brain lesions similar to mine, but she only had 3 protein bands.  She, too, had cognitive impairment but never took meds and was later told that she had a single incident rather than the disease.  However, when I took her records to my MS doctor, a leading doctor in the field, he said that she would now still be considered to have MS due to the current criteria.",Congenital / present at birth,Uncommon,Not applicable,Maybe,Yes,Yes,Yes,"I believe that I could access the genetic testing that I had done that verifies I am a tay sachs carrier.  

My multiple choice answers pertained to this trait, though I could also download info about the MS and may have a relative willing to participate who was also diagnosed.

HypoK-PP is an ion channel disorder that dangerously manifests with the use of hospital medications but also in response to food and the body's own internal chemistry. 

About 70% of HypoK-PP patients have a known genetic mutation. I am in the 30%, where the mutations are not found yet. My variant was said to be ""new"" in that it frequently includes a loss-of-consciousness component as well as paralysis and weakness in the episodes. 

In HypoK-PP, an abnormal amount of potassium shifts into the cells, losing the potential difference that the cells need to function. It means that muscles can't contract in a full blown attack or can't easily contract in a partial attack. In my case it includes daily paralytic and weakness reactions to food, and dangerous unexpected paralytic responses to medications in the hospital, for instance, where I am unexpectedly paralyzed and unable to move, including breathing muscles. 

I could not call out, gesture or push a button to tell anyone that I was in trouble. Luckily, unknown to me, my oxygen status was being monitored. After I lost consciousness due to anoxia, the team came in and provided mechanical breathing assistance. My breathing was not back to normal for several days. This is not the only hospital emergency like this that I have experienced -- this team was trying their hardest to avoid this type of problem, but we had the problem anyway. 

Episodes started in my late teens (1970) in response to food, where I would become incapacitated for 72 hours (three days) after many of my meals. With a carefully controlled diet, I was able to shorten the episodes, but not eliminate them. 

On a Holter monitor (in 2009) the EKG components of my episodes were measured. Starting in a fasting state, my EKG is normal, or even good, with a pulse rate of about 59 beats per minute. Within a half hour the episode is apparent, with many PVC's (premature ventricular contractions), other arrhythmias, and then tachycardia, going up to a resting pulse rate of about 128 bpm. The EKG's also showed breathing difficulty. 

That day the episodes resolved in about five hours, where the pulse rate slowly came back to normal. But then a new episode came on because it was time for the next meal. So the 24 hour Holter showed 15 hours of abnormal EKG's, in response to food, slowly resolving in five hours each, that day. 

I am otherwise very healthy, but these daily episodes are very bothersome and severely limit my quality of life. ",10-19 years of age,Very rare/uncommon,Very severe disease,Maybe,Yes,No,Yes,"1. I have excerpts from the 2009 Holter data that show the EKG's in response to food. 

2. I have strength tests over time, first without HypoK-PP medication and then with HypoK-PP medication (walking speed on elevated treadmill, etc.) Many of these medications become ineffective after about about six to twelve weeks. 

3. Finally, I have extensive results from a ""provocative test"" that was performed in my cardiologist's office. 

It is similar to a modified glucose tolerance test, where carbohydrates were ingested, and then, over time, various measurements are taken. 

Measurements included strength (walking speed on treadmill), serum glucose, serum insulin, serum potassium, also comments by cardiologist over time. 

There were some very unusual results -- my fasting insulin levels started at about 8% of normal (I started at around 0.6 microunits per ml, where normal fasting insulin is about 7.0 microunits per ml). After ingestion of glucose, when the insulin levels first rose to be about 1 microunit per ml, I lost 1/4 of my walking speed, and was barely able to walk by the time insulin levels rose to 5 microunits per ml. In normal subjects, postprandial insulin levels can easily go up to 140 microunits per ml. Mine rose up to about 35 microunits per ml. 

I was not ""ok"" again until the insulin levels fell down below 3.0 microunits per ml. 

The potassium shift into the tissues, out of the blood, was documented in response to the glucose ingestion, falling from 4.2 mEq down to 3.5, and then coming up to 3.9 -- all in the normal range. There were PVC's and arrhythmias during the test, too. 

This was not a severe attack, since I could still walk and did not lose consciousness -- in other attacks I can't move at all and also lose consciousness.

I submitted the following information via the web page at https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/formResponse?hl=en_US&formkey=dHRaNUxmUHdVaktxZXdsRlVyMlIwUUE6MQ&ifq

I must have an unusual genetic characteristic. No one with whom I have ever discussed the issue experienced the earth's magnetic field, etc. in the same way that I have. People who experience it differently probably imagine that I am insane.

Everyone must be sensitive to electromagnetic forces to some degree, e.g., when an electrical current or bolt of lighting runs through their bodies. If our cells were not sensitive to electro-magnetic forces, could our muscles contract, or our brains think?

I must be extra sensitive to electromagnetic fields and forces, possibly in the same or a similar way that whales, homing pigeons and other animals that must migrate great distances across the earth are.

I have travelled in over seventy countries, e.g., deep into equatorial forests, I have never felt lost. I always know where I am and how to get home.

When I was a child swinging back and forth in a swing caused me to feel as though my entire body was being tickled. The sensation was unbearable. I thought every child felt the same sensations. Later experiences caused me to ask other people if swinging back and forth caused their bodies to tingle when they were children. All of them have replied NO.

Many years later I sensed the heavy electro-magnetic forces that were building up in the atmosphere around me a few seconds before a mild bolt of lighting ran through my body. That lighting exited via my feet and some metal tools that I held in my hands (my fingers remained sore for a long time afterwards).

I wonder why I inherited these unusual characteristics. I am interested in genetic genealogy. My DNA tests and those of my cousins show that nearly all of my ancestors were Celts and Vikings from Scotland and Ireland. The Vikings sailed to America centuries before Columbus. I wonder if evolution caused them to develop some of the same genetic characteristics that whales, etc. have.

I bought a cheap cell phone a few years ago. I do not know if it was defective. My hands tingled when it rang or transmitted signals to the tower. The first and only call that I ever made via that cell phone lasted 52 minutes. Towards the end of that call I felt something creeping up the left side of my head (where I held the phone). The sensation became so awful that I ended the call without saying Goodbye. The left side of my head hurt so bad that I thought that I had a toothache or flu infection at first. The pain became unbearable and lasted for many years. My left eye stopped blinking. I am no longer able to focus my left eye. A large scab developed where I held the phone. The skin where I held the phone was discolored. I had tinnitus for years. The tissues in the left side of my head were damaged in other ways too. I shall not bore you with all the details.

I hope that whatever genes caused me to be so sensitive to electromagnetic forces will be discovered so that people who inherited them can be made aware of how cell phone use may affect them.

My geneticist visit is not until Spring 2013 at Johns Hopkins Hospital, but my Aug/Sep 2012 opthamologist, cardiology, radiology tests are all showing signs of connective tissue disorder of some kind, more like Ehlers-Danlos in my case (I.e. no aortic stem enlargement on my own 2012 echogram and only mitral valve degeneration, not full prolapse-- my father was 66 when his first echo was done and he died before a followup was done.).

Related to that, we believe I have one or more types of Porphyria.  It has not formally been diagnosed due to the difficulty in maintaining viable biological samples.  I have had my blood studied by the lab at Mt. Sinai Hospital, but they did not find that I had a mutation previously documented,  They did not do a sequencing of my genes.

I am a carrier for Hemochromatosis, which is strongly linked to one of the skin varieties of porphyria, PCT.  I have symptoms consistent with PCT, as well as EPP (another skin type, associated with congenital hemolytic anemia), and HCP, one of the acute porphyrias.

I have Wolfe Parkinson White Syndrome, a hereditary electrical disturbance in the heart, which has been corrected via ablation surgery.

I have other health problems, but these are the ones that are more severe and rare.

",Congenital / present at birth,Very rare/uncommon,Moderate severity disease,No,Yes,No,Yes,"I have the records from my birth, that discuss the hemolytic anemia.  The records had to be obtained from the naval hospital archives and are limited to a few pages of test results.

On the porphyria, I have very little, other than confirmation by the recognized expert on the subject,  Dr. Anderson from UTMB in Galveston, who said that my symptoms leave a strong suspicion of porphyria.  I have the negative genetic results from Mt. Sinai, which are not conclusive, since there are many unique mutations of Porphyria that have not been documented, due to limited availability (only Mt. Sinai in the US), the high cost of testing, and the fact that many may not even know about Porphyria to seek diagnosis.

On the WPW, I'm sure I could obtain an electrocardiogram that shows the unique electrical wave pattern of the disease.  Or something more from my cardiologist.  It was successfully ablated, so I no longer have it.  My maternal aunt also had WPW that was ablated.

I believe it to be possibly metabolic in nature.  I am unsure as to the possible severity, and even whether it is all related, but I am suspicious as my teen daughters seem to be following in my footsteps.  Doctors seem relatively unconcerned.

Beginning at puberty, I would feel extremely ill in the early mornings especially if I did not get enough rest - my youngest daughter vomits repeatedly and violently under the same conditions.  If genetic, she has it worse than I.

Also beginning at puberty, I have been unable to eat sugars on an empty stomach.  To do so results in a severe drop in blood sugar a couple of hours later, even to the point of near loss of consciousness when younger.  I never knew anyone who reacted as I do until my oldest daughter reached puberty and the same happened to her.  It continues occasionally to happen to her and I worry constantly as she has had some really bad spells that she had a difficult time pulling out of.  

Finally, throughout my lifetime I have had numerous unexpected reactions to various drugs, and I have had several unexplained losses of consciousness in the past few years, one especially severe that resulted in a head injury/fall.  These do not, however, seem to be linked to blood sugar issues as it was measured at 110 at the hospital immediately afterwards.

The first tumor was:

Low grad spindle cell metaplastic carcinoma arising from a sclerosed papilloma with and in situ squamous cell carcinoma component.

The second tumor was:

Microscopic examination reveals a malignant neoplasm, characterized by intermediate to high nuclear grade cellular proliferation. The tumor cells are predominantly spindle in shape and are focally arranged in short fascicles. In other areas they line irregular spaces leading to a pseudoangiosacromatous appearance. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrate strong immunoreactivity with cytokerartins CK AE1/3, CAM 5.2, CK 34BE12, CK 5/6 and p63 in the later areas and only focal staining in the spindle cell areas. The tumor cells are also strongly positive for vimentin, and negative for s-100, CD34 and SMA. 
Proliferation index (Ki-67) is positive, 22% nuclear staining (Unfavorable).
Ki67 clone MIB (Dako).
The morphologic features and the IHC results are consistent with metaplastic carcinoma with areas of spindle cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, acantolythic viariant.

I went to a urologist for help with an enlarged prostate and trouble urinating and erectile dysfunction and he told me that my penis was deformed and explained what was wrong. I read about it on the Wikipedia web site and apparently it is not that rare, but there are severe cases that require surgery.
